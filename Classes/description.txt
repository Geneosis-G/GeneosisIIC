[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]I got the idea of this little mod after discovering the Towel mutator in the City Bay map ^^ So I decided to make my own reference to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy that bring into the game more crazy stuff :p
This works the same way as the Target Swap: it swap the position of two items, the first one is the closest item to the player and the second one is a random item in the map.
The teleportation worked fine for NPCs and goats, but I had to make a specific case for the other objects because they don't support teleportation by default.
